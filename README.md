Our implementation is based on Secure Multi Party Computation where the user only knows his input and the final output. He is not able to view other users’ data. We have implemented this using RSA encryption. We have also implemented Homomorphic encryption more specifically, Yao’s Millionaires’ Protocol where we encrypt the values using Additive Modulus Encryption and the perform > operation to find the maximum value from the bids placed in the auction. We are using ‘Online Auctions Dataset’ from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/onlineauctions/online-auctions-dataset). Below is the detailed implementation.
Our algorithm operates in two stages. In the initial stage, we utilize the dataset 'auctions.csv' following preprocessing and cleaning of the data. We apply Additive Modulus Encryption to the 'bid' column and RSA encryption to the 'bidder' column. Additionally, we validate that the bid_time falls within the range of 0 to bid_end time and that the placed_bid is greater than or equal to the opening_bid. By imposing these constraints, we exclusively consider bids that meet these criteria. Subsequently, we store the encrypted data, including the bidder's username, bid amount, product name, and auction_id, in an empty dataframe.
In the second stage of our algorithm, we employ Yao's Millionaires' Protocol to determine the maximum bid among all encrypted bid values. In the initial stage, we employed Additive Modulus encryption to facilitate the subsequent application of the Millionaires' Protocol. This allowed us to efficiently compare all bids and determine the maximum bid among them. Subsequently, we compile a new dataset named 'winners.csv', which consolidates data on the maximum bid, along with the bidder's username, auction_id, and product name. This dataset serves as a resource for users to ascertain whether they were successful in the auction.
Users utilize their private key to decrypt the dataset, enabling them to ascertain their auction outcomes. They are restricted to viewing only their own outcomes, as any data pertaining to other users remains encrypted from their view. For instance, when a user employs their private key to access the dataset and observes their username, it indicates that they have emerged as the winning bidder for a product in the auction. Conversely, if a user fails to secure a bid, they will encounter an improperly decrypted text in place of the username. This signifies that no other user, apart from the winner, can discern who secured the bid.

Presently, our RSA encryption implementation relies on smaller prime numbers due to the significant computational burden posed by larger primes. Despite incorporating code to accommodate larger primes, we've opted for smaller ones to mitigate computational overheads. Looking ahead, as computational capacities advance, we anticipate transitioning to larger primes and generating unique key pairs for each user.

Currently, our output is limited to the console display. However, improving user interaction with a simplified interface shows potential for expanding functionality. This interface could facilitate the integration of extra features. A web-based application stands out as the optimal platform for developing a comprehensive auction platform.
